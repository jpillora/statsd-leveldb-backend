statsd-leveldb-backend
======================

A backend for StatsD to emit stats to leveldb. Implements the Robin robin **like** database, described in [this comment](https://github.com/rvagg/node-levelup/issues/154#issuecomment-20391086) on the levelup project.

### Goal

***A pure Node statsd stack*** - As statsd only defines the daemon for capturing data, when using it, one also needs to store the data in a statsd compatible "backend" (or database). Then, another tool is used to query this data and display the results. This is just the "backend" portion of the stack - Querying and Graphing still to come. Initial thoughts are leaning towards a pure frontend JavaScript solution, via a WebSockets API, from a server capable of streaming out responses to queries for instant graphing.

### Usage

**Still in prototyping phase...** :smile:
